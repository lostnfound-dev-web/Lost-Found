# Lost-Found
The system is meant to help students manage lost and found items more efficiently within the university. From a user’s point of view, the main purpose of the application is to allow anyone who has lost or found an item to report it in a structured way and to make it easier for both parties to get matched. A student who lost something can log in and create a report with details such as item id, name, category, description, photo, date and location where it was lost. On the other side, someone who found an item can also file a report with similar details. Each report is tied to a status (Pending or Accepted) which will be managed by an administrator who verifies the information and ensures that only valid reports are stored.
For regular users (students), the interaction is simple: they can create, view and search reports to check whether their lost item has been found or whether something they found was already reported as missing. Students also have the option to track the progress of their reports as they move from Pending to Accepted.
For administrators, the system provides tools to verify and approve reports so that only accurate entries appear in the system. Admins also have the responsibility of updating the status of items to “Found” once they are returned to their owners. This ensures that the database always reflects the current situation of each case.
The goal of the application is to reduce confusion and give students one reliable place where they can report, track and resolve lost and found cases more easily.
